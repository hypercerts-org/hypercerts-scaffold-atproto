The PDS currently runs stock `@atproto/pds` in standalone mode (it is its own authorization server). We need to:\n1. Co-deploy the sidecar auth service with the PDS\n2. Configure the PDS so the sidecar can override its OAuth authorization server metadata\n3. Set up Docker Compose with Caddy for TLS (sidecar on auth subdomain, PDS on main domain)\n4. Configure SMTP for OTP email delivery\n5. Test the complete flow: scaffold → PDS (PAR) → sidecar (email + OTP) → PDS (auth code) → scaffold (callback)\n6. Handle existing users who have password-based accounts\n\n## Architecture\n```\nInternet\n  │\n  ▼\nCaddy (TLS termination, routing)\n  ├── pds.certs.network      → PDS Core (port 3000)\n  ├── auth.pds.certs.network → Sidecar Auth Service (port 3001)\n  └── *.pds.certs.network    → PDS Core (handle resolution)\n```\n\nBoth PDS and sidecar run in the same Docker Compose stack, sharing:\n- A Docker network (sidecar can reach PDS internally)\n- A shared HMAC secret for signed callbacks\n- The sidecar has access to the PDS's `OAuthProvider` instance (same process or via internal API)\n\n## Key Concerns\n- **Existing users:** Users who created accounts with passwords can still log in — the sidecar should check if an email exists in the PDS and authenticate accordingly. Password reset flow (`com.atproto.server.resetPassword`) must remain available as a recovery path.\n- **DNS:** Need wildcard DNS for handle resolution (`*.pds.certs.network`) plus the auth subdomain\n- **TLS:** Caddy handles automatic TLS via Let's Encrypt. Need DNS challenge for wildcard certs.\n- **Email deliverability:** SPF/DKIM/DMARC records on the sending domain. Use a reputable SMTP provider.\n- **Monitoring:** Health checks, structured logging (pino), basic metrics endpoint\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Docker Compose stack starts cleanly with PDS + sidecar + Caddy\n- OAuth metadata at `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` shows sidecar's `authorization_endpoint`\n- Complete login flow works from scaffold app to PDS and back\n- OTP emails are delivered reliably\n- Existing password-based users can still authenticate\n- TLS works on all endpoints\n- Health checks pass for all services","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","assignee":"sharfy-test.climateai.org","owner":"sharfy-test.climateai.org","created_at":"2026-02-17T18:12:26.180448+08:00","created_by":"sharfy-test.climateai.org","updated_at":"2026-02-18T15:50:27.582864+08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-18T15:50:27.582867+08:00","labels":["scope:medium"]}

{"id":"hypercerts-2bf","title":"Epic: Scaffold Email-First Auth UI","description":"## Goal\nBuild a new email-first login page at `/login` in the hypercerts-scaffold Next.js app. This page replaces the handle-based login flow with an email input that initiates ATProto OAuth with the user's email passed as `login_hint`. The old handle-based login (`LoginDialog` component, `SignedInProvider` gate) remains untouched — both flows coexist so we can test the new flow independently.\n\n## Context\nThe scaffold app currently requires users to enter their ATProto handle (e.g., `alice.certified.app`) to log in. This is confusing for non-technical users. We're building email-first passwordless login where users enter their email, receive a 6-digit OTP code, and are authenticated — no handles, no passwords.\n\nThe scaffold's role is the **client side** of this flow. A separate PDS sidecar service (different repo) handles the server-side OTP generation/verification. The scaffold just needs to:\n1. Collect the user's email\n2. Pass it as `login_hint` in the ATProto OAuth authorization URL\n3. Handle the standard OAuth callback (unchanged)\n\nThe PDS sidecar intercepts the OAuth authorization endpoint and uses the `login_hint` to send an OTP email immediately, so the user sees an OTP input (not a password form) at the PDS.\n\n## Technical Background\n- **Framework:** Next.js 16 with App Router\n- **Current auth flow:** User enters handle → POST `/api/auth/login` → `sdk.authorize(handle)` → redirect to PDS → password form → callback → session cookie\n- **New auth flow:** User enters email → POST `/api/auth/login` with email + `login_hint` → `sdk.authorize(pdsUrl, { login_hint: email })` → redirect to PDS sidecar → OTP form → callback → session cookie\n- **Key files:** `components/login-dialog.tsx`, `app/api/auth/login/route.ts`, `lib/config.ts`, `lib/hypercerts-sdk.ts`, `providers/SignedInProvider.tsx`\n- **UI components available:** shadcn/ui (Button, Input, Card, InputGroup, Spinner, etc.), Tailwind CSS, fonts: Syne (headings), Outfit (body)\n- **SDK:** `@hypercerts-org/sdk-core` wraps `@atproto/oauth-client-node`. The `sdk.authorize()` method accepts a handle, DID, or PDS URL.\n\n## Success Criteria\n- New `/login` page exists with email input and unified sign-in/sign-up flow\n- Email is passed as `login_hint` through the OAuth flow\n- Old handle-based login still works at the root (SignedInProvider + LoginDialog unchanged)\n- OAuth callback handles both flows identically\n- No new environment variables required (uses existing `NEXT_PUBLIC_PDS_URL`)","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","assignee":"sharfy-test.climateai.org","owner":"sharfy-test.climateai.org","created_at":"2026-02-17T18:11:29.861164+08:00","created_by":"sharfy-test.climateai.org","updated_at":"2026-02-18T15:50:27.406478+08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-18T15:50:27.406482+08:00","labels":["scope:medium"]}

This is the server-side counterpart to the `useEmailLoginMutation` hook.\n\n### Route: `POST /api/auth/email-login`\n\n**Request body:**\n```json\n{ \"email\": \"user@example.com\" }\n```\n\n**Logic:**\n1. Parse the request body and extract `email`\n2. Validate that `email` is present and is a valid email format (basic regex or just check for `@`)\n3. Call `sdk.authorize()` to initiate the OAuth flow. The key difference from the existing `/api/auth/login` route is:\n   - Pass the **PDS URL** (from `config.pdsUrl`, i.e., `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PDS_URL`) as the first argument — NOT the email. The PDS URL tells the SDK which authorization server to use.\n   - Pass the email as `login_hint` in the authorization URL. The `@atproto/oauth-client-node` SDK's `authorize()` method may not directly support `login_hint` as a parameter. If it doesn't, you need to:\n     a. First try: check if `sdk.authorize(pdsUrl, { login_hint: email })` works (check the SDK types)\n     b. If not: get the authorization URL from `sdk.authorize(pdsUrl)` and append `\u0026login_hint=${encodeURIComponent(email)}` to the URL before returning it\n4. Return `{ authUrl: \u003cthe authorization URL\u003e }` as JSON\n\n**Response (success):**\n```json\n{ \"authUrl\": \"https://pds.certs.network/oauth/authorize?...\u0026login_hint=user%40example.com\" }\n```\n\n**Response (error):**\n```json\n{ \"error\": \"Email is required\" }  // 400\n{ \"error\": \"Failed to initiate login process\" }  // 500\n```\n\n### Important: Understanding `sdk.authorize()`\nThe existing login route calls `sdk.authorize(handle)` where `handle` is a user's ATProto handle (e.g., `alice.bsky.social`). The SDK resolves the handle to find the user's PDS/authorization server.\n\nFor email login, we don't have a handle — we have an email. We know the PDS URL (`NEXT_PUBLIC_PDS_URL`), so we pass that directly. The SDK will use it to find the authorization server. The `login_hint` parameter is an OAuth standard parameter that the authorization server (our sidecar) will use to pre-fill the email and send the OTP immediately.\n\n### Reference: Existing login route\n```typescript\n// app/api/auth/login/route.ts (DO NOT MODIFY)\nimport sdk from '@/lib/hypercerts-sdk';\nexport async function POST(request: Request) {\n  const body = await request.json();\n  const handle = body.handle;\n  try {\n    const authUrl = await sdk.authorize(handle);\n    return NextResponse.json({ authUrl });\n  } catch (e) {\n    console.error('Failed to initiate login process', e);\n    return Response.json({ error: 'Failed to initiate login process' }, { status: 500 });\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Don't\n- Don't modify the existing `/api/auth/login` route\n- Don't modify the existing `/api/auth/callback` route (the callback is the same for both flows)\n- Don't add new environment variables\n- Don't try to resolve email→handle or email→DID on the scaffold side (that's the sidecar's job)","acceptance_criteria":"1.

Each app gets independent OAuth tokens (DPoP-bound) for the same DID.\n\n## Context\nThe scaffold app (hypercerts-scaffold) already has a working OAuth flow:\n- POST /api/auth/login initiates OAuth via sdk.authorize(handle)\n- GET /api/auth/callback handles the OAuth callback\n- Session stored in Redis via @atproto/oauth-client-node\n- DPoP token binding is handled by the SDK\n\nThe key change for email-first auth: instead of `sdk.authorize(handle)`, apps call `sdk.authorize('https://certified.app')` with `login_hint=email`. This skips handle resolution entirely.\n\nThe /login page and /api/auth/email-login route were built on the beads/plan-passwordless-login branch (tasks hypercerts-2bf.1, 2bf.2, 2bf.3 — all completed). These need to be merged to main and verified.\n\n### BFF Pattern\nEach Certified app runs its own backend that:\n1. Has its own OAuth client_id (derived from its public URL per ATProto spec)\n2. Stores its own session/state in Redis\n3. Calls sdk.authorize('https://certified.app', { login_hint: email })\n4. Handles its own /api/auth/callback\n5. Gets DPoP-bound tokens for the user's DID\n\nThe PDS sees each app as a separate OAuth client. The user consents once per app.\n\n## What Has to Be Built\n1. Verify the email-login flow works end-to-end with the sidecar (merge from beads branch)\n2. Document the BFF integration pattern for other Certified apps\n3. Create a minimal example/template that GainForest/Silvi can copy\n4. Add 'Sign in with Certified' button component that's reusable across apps\n\n## Hard Constraints\n- Each app MUST have its own OAuth client_id (no shared clients)\n- Each app MUST run its own backend (no shared sessions)\n- The PDS URL is hardcoded to 'https://certified.app' (or configured via env var)\n- login_hint MUST be passed as email for the sidecar to auto-send OTP\n\n## Success Looks Like\n- Scaffold app authenticates via email-first flow against the Certified PDS\n- Integration guide exists for other Certified apps\n- Reusable 'Sign in with Certified' button component exists\n- Example .env and route files for a new Certified app","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","assignee":"sharfy-test.climateai.org","owner":"sharfy-test.climateai.org","created_at":"2026-02-18T14:05:23.165082+08:00","created_by":"sharfy-test.climateai.org","updated_at":"2026-02-18T15:44:49.588829+08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-18T15:44:49.588832+08:00","labels":["scope:medium"]}

This determines whether we can reuse the prototype or must rebuild the auth layer.\n\nAdditionally, we already have a pds-sidecar built in this repo (packages/pds-sidecar/) with OTP service, rate limiter, HMAC callback signer, mailer, auth-service routes, and PDS core wrapper. We need to determine the overlap and best path forward.\n\n## Key Questions to Answer\n1. Is holkexyz/atproto actually deployed at pds.certs.network? How far has it diverged from upstream?\n2. How does magic-pds authenticate against the PDS? Hidden-password? Direct DB access? Fork-specific API?\n3. Is magic-pds modifying PDS internals or purely wrapping it?\n4. What hardening exists? Rate limiting, OTP expiry, error handling, email deliverability?\n5. Can we migrate to a stock PDS without breaking magic-pds?\n6. How does our existing pds-sidecar compare to magic-pds? What's the delta?\n\n## Success Looks Like\nA written assessment document (markdown) in docs/ that answers all 6 questions above with concrete evidence (code references, deployment configs, test results). Clear recommendation on whether to adopt magic-pds, adapt our pds-sidecar, or hybrid approach.\n\n## Scope\nResearch and documentation only.

This is the critical path — everything else can follow.\n\n## What Option A1 Is\nOne stock (unmodified) PDS at certified.app. A separate sidecar auth service handles passwordless UX — OTP generation, email sending, code validation — and authenticates against the PDS using auto-generated passwords the user never sees. Apps use oauthClient.authorize('https://certified.app') with login_hint=email. No handle entry needed. The PDS stays vanilla and upgradeable.\n\n## What's Already Built\n- **Scaffold UI** (beads branch): /login page with email input, /api/auth/email-login route, useEmailLoginMutation hook (3 tasks completed: hypercerts-2bf.1, 2bf.2, 2bf.3)\n- **PDS Sidecar** (beads branch): OTP service (8-digit, SHA-256 hashed, 15min expiry, 5 max attempts), rate limiter (per-email, per-IP), HMAC callback signer, mailer, auth-service Express routes (/oauth/authorize, /auth/send-code, /auth/verify-code), PDS core wrapper with OAuth metadata override + magic-callback endpoint (7 tasks completed: hypercerts-qc3.1-7)\n- **Docker Compose** (beads branch): Caddy + PDS + sidecar stack (1 task completed: hypercerts-0yp.1)\n- **Local dev setup** (beads branch): Startup script + .env for PDS at localhost:2583, sidecar at localhost:2584, MailHog at localhost:8025 (1 task completed: hypercerts-mhp.1)\n\n## What's Left (this epic)\n1. Merge all completed work from beads/plan-passwordless-login to this branch\n2. Get the local E2E flow working (hypercerts-mhp.2 is in progress but not done)\n3. Add encrypted credential storage (AES-256-GCM for auto-generated passwords)\n4. Add security headers + production error handling to sidecar\n5. Update Docker Compose for certified.app domain\n6. Create production .env template + DNS/email deliverability docs\n7. Add 'Sign in with ATProto/Bluesky' handle fallback to /login page\n8. E2E smoke test\n\n## Auth Flow (what the user sees)\n1. On Ma Earth, clicks 'Sign in with Certified'\n2. Redirected to certified.app/oauth/authorize\n3. Enters email address\n4. Receives OTP code via email\n5. Enters code\n6. Approves Ma Earth's access (OAuth consent)\n7. Redirected back to Ma Earth, logged in\n\nSign-up is identical: if email is new, account auto-created (random handle, hidden password).\n\n## Hard Constraints\n- Stock PDS only — no fork of bluesky-social/atproto\n- All passwordless logic in the sidecar, not the PDS\n- Auto-generated passwords encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM)\n- Sign-up and sign-in visually identical (anti-enumeration)\n- Must ship within days, not weeks","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","assignee":"sharfy-test.climateai.org","owner":"sharfy-test.climateai.org","created_at":"2026-02-18T15:42:34.248702+08:00","created_by":"sharfy-test.climateai.org","updated_at":"2026-02-18T15:44:40.103073+08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-18T15:44:40.103077+08:00","labels":["scope:medium"]}

{"id":"hypercerts-mhp","title":"Epic: Local Test PDS with Sidecar for End-to-End OTP Flow","description":"## Goal\nSet up a local test PDS with the sidecar auth service so we can test the complete email-first passwordless login flow end-to-end on localhost. The user enters their email in the scaffold app → gets redirected to the sidecar → receives an OTP email → enters the code → gets redirected back to the scaffold with an active session.\n\n## Context\nWe have built:\n1. **Scaffold app** (Next.js at `/Users/sharfy/Code/hypercerts-scaffold`) — has a `/login` page with email input that calls `/api/auth/email-login`, which initiates ATProto OAuth with `login_hint=\u003cemail\u003e`. The scaffold runs on `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.\n2. **PDS sidecar** (at `packages/pds-sidecar/`) — contains three packages:\n   - `packages/shared/` — OTP service, rate limiter, HMAC callback signer, mailer, SQLite DB\n   - `packages/auth-service/` — Express app that serves email input + OTP verification pages\n   - `packages/pds-core/` — Wraps stock `@atproto/pds` with OAuth metadata override + magic-callback endpoint\n\nThe sidecar code is built and tests pass (56/56). But we've never run the full stack together. The current Docker Compose setup (`packages/pds-sidecar/docker-compose.yml`) is designed for production with Caddy, real DNS, and TLS — it won't work on localhost.\n\n## What We Need\nA **local development setup** that runs all three services on localhost without Docker, TLS, or real DNS:\n\n```\nScaffold (Next.js)     → http://127.0.0.1:3000\nPDS Core (ATProto PDS) → http://localhost:2583\nAuth Service (sidecar) → http://localhost:2584\nMailHog (fake SMTP)    → SMTP on :1025, Web UI on http://localhost:8025\n```\n\n### How the flow works\n1. User visits `http://127.0.0.1:3000/login`, enters email, clicks Continue\n2. Scaffold POSTs to `/api/auth/email-login` → calls `sdk.authorize('http://localhost:2583')` with `login_hint=email`\n3. SDK does PAR to PDS at `http://localhost:2583`\n4. PDS returns authorization URL → but metadata override rewrites `authorization_endpoint` to `http://localhost:2584/oauth/authorize`\n5. Browser redirects to sidecar at `http://localhost:2584/oauth/authorize?request_uri=...\u0026login_hint=email`\n6. Sidecar auto-sends OTP email via MailHog (SMTP on localhost:1025)\n7. User opens MailHog web UI at `http://localhost:8025`, copies the 8-digit code\n8. User enters code on sidecar's OTP page\n9. Sidecar verifies code, builds HMAC-signed callback URL\n10. Browser redirects to PDS at `http://localhost:2583/oauth/magic-callback?...\u0026sig=HMAC...`\n11. PDS verifies HMAC, creates account if new, issues OAuth auth code\n12. Browser redirects back to scaffold at `http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/auth/callback?code=...\u0026state=...\u0026iss=....`\n13. Scaffold exchanges code for session → user is logged in\n\n### Key Technical Challenges\n1. **ATProto PDS requires specific env vars and crypto keys** — PLC rotation key (secp256k1), JWT secret, admin password. These must be generated.\n2. **The PDS needs to reach the PLC directory** — `https://plc.directory` for DID creation. This requires internet access.\n3. **OAuth client ID for localhost** — The scaffold uses `http://localhost?scope=...` as client ID in dev mode (loopback client). The PDS must accept loopback clients.\n4. **The PDS hostname must match what the scaffold sends** — The scaffold's `NEXT_PUBLIC_PDS_URL` must point to the local PDS.\n5. **The auth service URL in the metadata override must be reachable from the browser** — It's `http://localhost:2584`.\n6. **MailHog for fake SMTP** — No real email provider needed. MailHog captures all emails and shows them in a web UI.\n7. **The `pds-core` wrapper uses PDS internal APIs** — These are accessed via `as any` casts and may not work exactly as expected.

{"id":"hypercerts-mhp.1","title":"Create local dev startup script and .env for PDS + sidecar + MailHog","description":"## Files\n- packages/pds-sidecar/scripts/dev-start.sh (create)\n- packages/pds-sidecar/.env.dev (create)\n- packages/pds-sidecar/scripts/generate-pds-keys.mjs (create)\n\n## What to do\nCreate a local development startup script that runs the PDS, auth service, and MailHog together on localhost without Docker or TLS. This is for testing the full email→OTP→session flow locally.\n\n### Architecture\n```\nScaffold (Next.js)     → http://127.0.0.1:3000  (started separately by the developer)\nPDS Core (ATProto PDS) → http://localhost:2583   (started by this script)\nAuth Service (sidecar) → http://localhost:2584   (started by this script)\nMailHog (fake SMTP)    → SMTP on :1025, Web UI on http://localhost:8025 (Docker)\n```\n\n### `scripts/generate-pds-keys.mjs`\nA Node.js script that generates all required crypto keys and outputs them as environment variables. It should:\n1. Generate a PLC rotation key (secp256k1 private key, 64 hex chars). Use `@noble/secp256k1` or `crypto.generateKeyPairSync('ec', { namedCurve: 'secp256k1' })` and extract the private key as hex. If those don't work, use `crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex')` — the PDS will validate it.\n2. Generate a JWT secret: `crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex')`\n3. Generate a session secret: `crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex')`\n4. Generate a callback secret: `crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex')`\n5. Generate an admin password: `crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('hex')`\n6. Print them all as KEY=VALUE lines that can be pasted into .env.dev\n\n### `.env.dev`\nPre-configured environment file for local development. All values should work out of the box EXCEPT the crypto keys (which the developer generates with the script above). Include clear comments.\n\n```env\n# PDS Core\nPDS_HOSTNAME=localhost\nPDS_PORT=2583\nPDS_DATA_DIRECTORY=./data/pds\nPDS_BLOBSTORE_DISK_LOCATION=./data/pds/blobs\nPDS_DID_PLC_URL=https://plc.directory\nPDS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=\u003cgenerated\u003e\nPDS_JWT_SECRET=\u003cgenerated\u003e\nPDS_PLC_ROTATION_KEY_K256_PRIVATE_KEY_HEX=\u003cgenerated\u003e\n\n# Auth Service\nAUTH_PORT=2584\nAUTH_DB_PATH=./data/auth/auth.sqlite\nSESSION_SECRET=\u003cgenerated\u003e\nCALLBACK_SECRET=\u003cgenerated\u003e\nPDS_URL=http://localhost:2583\nAUTH_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:2584\n\n# SMTP (MailHog)\nSMTP_HOST=localhost\nSMTP_PORT=1025\nSMTP_SECURE=false\nSMTP_USER=\nSMTP_PASS=\nSMTP_FROM=Hypercerts Scaffold \u003cnoreply@localhost\u003e\n\n# Sidecar DB (used by PDS core)\nSIDECAR_DB_PATH=./data/pds/sidecar.sqlite\n```\n\n### `scripts/dev-start.sh`\nA bash script that:\n1. Checks prerequisites: Node.js \u003e= 20, Docker (for MailHog)\n2. Creates data directories: `./data/pds/blobs`, `./data/auth`\n3. Checks if `.env.dev` has been configured (look for `\u003cgenerated\u003e` placeholder values). If not, run `generate-pds-keys.mjs` and tell the user to paste the output into `.env.dev`.\n4. Loads `.env.dev` into the shell environment\n5. Starts MailHog via Docker: `docker run -d --name mailhog-dev -p 1025:1025 -p 8025:8025 mailhog/mailhog` (skip if already running)\n6. Builds the sidecar packages: `npm run build`\n7. Starts the PDS core in the background: `node packages/pds-core/dist/index.js \u0026`\n8. Waits for PDS health check: poll `http://localhost:2583/xrpc/_health` until it responds (max 30 seconds)\n9. Starts the auth service in the background: `node packages/auth-service/dist/index.js \u0026`\n10. Waits for auth health check: poll `http://localhost:2584/health` until it responds\n11. Prints a summary:\n    ```\n    ✅ All services running:\n       PDS:         http://localhost:2583\n       Auth:        http://localhost:2584\n       MailHog:     http://localhost:8025\n       \n    Next: Start the scaffold app:\n       cd /Users/sharfy/Code/hypercerts-scaffold\n       # Update .env.local: NEXT_PUBLIC_PDS_URL=http://localhost:2583\n       npm run dev\n       # Then visit http://127.0.0.1:3000/login\n    ```\n12. Waits for Ctrl+C, then kills both background processes and stops MailHog\n\nMake the script executable (`chmod +x`).\n\n### Important: PDS_HOSTNAME for localhost\nThe ATProto PDS uses `PDS_HOSTNAME` to determine its issuer URL. For local dev, set it to `localhost`. The PDS will serve on the port specified by `PDS_PORT` env var (which `@atproto/pds` reads from `readEnv()`). Check the PDS source — it may use `PDS_PORT` or default to 2583. If the PDS doesn't read `PDS_PORT`, you may need to set it via the config object in `packages/pds-core/src/index.ts`.\n\n### Important: PDS_PORT configuration\nThe current `packages/pds-core/src/index.ts` uses `readEnv()` + `envToCfg()` from `@atproto/pds`. Check if `PDS_PORT` is read by `readEnv()`. If not, you may need to modify `index.ts` to accept a port override. The PDS default port is 2583.\n\n### Important: AUTH_SERVICE_URL\nThe `AUTH_SERVICE_URL` env var is used by the PDS core's metadata override to rewrite `authorization_endpoint`. For local dev, it must be `http://localhost:2584` — this is the URL the **browser** will be redirected to, so it must be reachable from the developer's machine.\n\n## Don't\n- Don't modify any existing source files unless absolutely necessary (e.g., if PDS_PORT isn't configurable)\n- Don't use Docker for the PDS or auth service — run them directly with Node.js\n- Don't require real DNS or TLS\n- Don't commit actual secret values — use placeholders in .env.dev\n- Don't modify the scaffold app's .env.local (just document what needs to change)","acceptance_criteria":"1. `node scripts/generate-pds-keys.mjs` outputs valid KEY=VALUE pairs for all required secrets\n2. `scripts/dev-start.sh` starts MailHog, PDS, and auth service without errors\n3. `curl http://localhost:2583/xrpc/_health` returns a success response\n4. `curl http://localhost:2584/health` returns `{\"status\":\"ok\"}`\n5. `curl http://localhost:2583/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` returns JSON with `authorization_endpoint` containing `http://localhost:2584/oauth/authorize`\n6.

If the API shape doesn't match, you'll get runtime errors. Debug by reading the actual PDS source in `node_modules/@atproto/pds/` and adjusting the code.\n- **OAuth redirect URI mismatch** — The scaffold's redirect URI must match what the PDS expects. Check the error messages.\n- **CORS issues** — The sidecar may need CORS headers for cross-origin requests from the scaffold.\n- **Cookie issues** — The sidecar sets session cookies. These may not work across different localhost ports. May need `SameSite=None` or same-origin setup.\n\n### Step 5: Document what works and what doesn't\nCreate a brief summary of:\n- What worked out of the box\n- What needed fixing (and what the fix was)\n- Any remaining issues\n\n## Don't\n- Don't modify the sidecar code unless there are actual runtime errors that need fixing\n- Don't change the scaffold's auth flow logic\n- Don't commit .env.local to git (it's in .gitignore)","acceptance_criteria":"1.

{"id":"hypercerts-mws","title":"Epic: Sidecar Auth Service (OTP + PDS Wrapper)","description":"## Goal\nBuild a standalone sidecar auth service that runs alongside a stock @atproto/pds to provide email-first passwordless login via OTP codes. This is the core backend for Option A1.\n\n## Architecture (Option A1)\n```\nClient App (scaffold)\n  │\n  │ 1. PAR request to PDS\n  │ 8. Token exchange (stock ATProto)\n  ▼\nStock PDS (@atproto/pds, unmodified npm package)\n  │  OAuth AS metadata overridden:\n  │  authorization_endpoint → sidecar\n  │\n  │ 2. Redirect to sidecar    7.

Sends 8-digit OTP code via email\n  ▼\nUser's inbox\n```\n\n## How It Works\n1. Client calls `sdk.authorize('https://certified.app')` with `login_hint=email`\n2. SDK does PAR to PDS → PDS returns authorization URL\n3. But the PDS's OAuth metadata has been overridden: `authorization_endpoint` points to the sidecar\n4. Browser redirects to sidecar's /oauth/authorize with the PAR request_uri + login_hint\n5. Sidecar sends OTP email, shows code entry form\n6. User enters code → sidecar verifies → builds HMAC-signed callback URL\n7. Browser redirects to PDS's /oauth/magic-callback with signed params\n8. PDS verifies HMAC, creates account if new (random handle + hidden password), issues OAuth auth code\n9. Browser redirects back to client with auth code → client exchanges for tokens\n\n## Key Design Decisions\n- **Wrap, don't fork.** @atproto/pds is an npm dependency, not modified source.\n- **HMAC-SHA256 signed callback** between sidecar and PDS to prevent account takeover.\n- **Unified sign-in/sign-up.** New emails get auto-created; existing emails get authenticated. Both look identical.\n- **Random handles.** New accounts get random handles (e.g., a3x9kf.certified.app) — no email leakage.\n- **8-digit OTP codes.** SHA-256 hashed before storage, single-use, 15-min expiry, max 5 attempts.\n- **Auto-generated passwords.** Users never see a password. Backend generates 128-char hex passwords, encrypts with AES-256-GCM, stores server-side.\n\n## Project Structure\n```\npackages/pds-sidecar/\n  package.json              ← root workspace\n  tsconfig.json\n  docker-compose.yml        ← Caddy + PDS + sidecar\n  Caddyfile\n  .env.example\n  scripts/\n    start-local.sh          ← local dev: PDS + sidecar + MailHog\n  packages/\n    shared/                 ← DB, OTP service, rate limiter, HMAC signer, mailer, credential store\n    auth-service/           ← Express app (routes, middleware, templates)\n    pds-core/               ← PDS wrapper (metadata override, magic-callback, account creator)\n```\n\n## What Exists on Main\npackages/pds-sidecar/ has compiled dist/ files from a previous prototype but NO source code, NO package.json, NO tsconfig.

This is independent of the auth flow and can be built in parallel.\n\n## Context\nATProto has NO native org support. Every repo has exactly one signing key. All org logic lives in our application layer. The architecture doc specifies:\n- Our backend maintains org membership (user_did → [org_ids])\n- Roles: admin (manage members + write + delete), contributor (write), viewer (read)\n- Org repos are DID-based PDS accounts whose signing keys we hold server-side\n- The org/RBAC layer is completely independent of how users authenticate\n\n### How Orgs Work\nEach org is a regular ATProto account on the PDS. The difference:\n- The org's signing key (password) is held by our backend, encrypted with AES-256-GCM\n- Our backend mediates all writes: User → Scaffold API → RBAC check → PDS write as org account\n- Users never directly interact with the org's PDS credentials\n\n### Data Model\n- organizations: id (UUID), did, handle, name, created_at\n- org_memberships: org_id + user_did (composite PK), role, invited_by, created_at\n\n## What Has to Be Built\n1. OrgStore — data access layer for orgs and memberships (SQLite)\n2. PdsAdminService — creates/deletes org PDS accounts, manages encrypted credentials\n3. PdsRecordService — RBAC-gated CRUD on org repos via XRPC\n4. Org API routes — REST endpoints for org management\n5. Scaffold UI — org listing page after login\n\n## Hard Constraints\n- All org data in sidecar SQLite (same DB as auth data)\n- Org PDS accounts created via com.atproto.server.createAccount (XRPC, not internal API)\n- Org credentials encrypted at rest (reuse CredentialStore from shared package)\n- Stock PDS only — no protocol changes\n- Must work with any ATProto Lexicon (hypercerts, profiles, etc.)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","assignee":"sharfy-test.climateai.org","owner":"sharfy-test.climateai.org","created_at":"2026-02-18T15:48:27.289644+08:00","created_by":"sharfy-test.climateai.org","updated_at":"2026-02-18T15:54:59.840465+08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-18T15:54:59.840467+08:00","labels":["scope:medium"]}

{"id":"hypercerts-p5n","title":"Epic: Unified Sign-up/Sign-in Flow with Handle Assignment","description":"## Goal\nImplement a unified auth flow where sign-up and sign-in are identical from the user's perspective. User enters email → gets OTP → enters code → they're in. If the email is new, an account is auto-created. If existing, they're logged in. Handle assignment is automatic and invisible.\n\n## Context\nThe architecture doc specifies Option A1: application-layer OTP + hidden password. The pds-sidecar already has:\n- AccountCreator (packages/pds-sidecar/packages/pds-core/dist/account-creator.js) that creates accounts with random handles (6-char base36 + domain) and random passwords\n- OTP verification flow in auth-service routes\n- verify-code route that checks if account exists and builds HMAC callback\n\nWhat's MISSING:\n1. **Email→account lookup before OTP send**: The send-code route should check if the email already has an account and behave identically either way (anti-enumeration)\n2. **Handle collision detection**: randomBase36(6) could collide. Need retry logic.\n3. **Handle customization later**: Users should be able to change their handle after signup (not in this epic, but the schema should support it)\n4. **Credential storage integration**: AccountCreator generates a random password but doesn't store it encrypted via CredentialStore (from Epic: OTP Hardening)\n5. **Email verification status**: Track whether an email has been verified via OTP at least once\n\n## User Flow (detailed)\n1. User enters email on scaffold /login page\n2. Scaffold calls /api/auth/email-login with email\n3. SDK calls authorize('https://certified.app') with login_hint=email\n4. PDS returns auth URL → sidecar's /oauth/authorize\n5. Sidecar receives login_hint, auto-sends OTP email\n6. User enters 8-digit code\n7. Sidecar verifies code\n8. If new email: sidecar creates account (random handle, random encrypted password), stores credentials\n9. If existing email: sidecar looks up DID from accounts table\n10. Sidecar builds HMAC-signed callback → PDS magic-callback → OAuth code → scaffold callback → session\n\n## Hard Constraints\n- Sign-up and sign-in MUST be visually identical (anti-enumeration)\n- Handle format: `{random6}.certified.app` (or configured domain)\n- Auto-generated passwords: 128 hex chars, encrypted via CredentialStore\n- No user-visible password at any point\n- Stock PDS — account creation via com.atproto.server.createAccount or PDS internal OAuthStore.createAccount\n\n## Success Looks Like\n- New email → account created → OTP verified → session established\n- Existing email → OTP verified → session established\n- Both flows look identical to the user\n- Handle collisions are retried automatically (max 5 attempts)\n- Credentials stored encrypted","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","assignee":"sharfy-test.climateai.org","owner":"sharfy-test.climateai.org","created_at":"2026-02-18T14:04:18.311383+08:00","created_by":"sharfy-test.climateai.org","updated_at":"2026-02-18T15:44:49.22461+08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-18T15:44:49.224613+08:00","labels":["scope:medium"]}

{"id":"hypercerts-qc3","title":"Epic: PDS Sidecar Auth Service","description":"## Goal\nBuild a standalone Express.js auth service that runs alongside the stock `@atproto/pds` package to provide email-first passwordless login via OTP codes. This lives in `packages/pds-sidecar/` within the hypercerts-scaffold repo (same PR as the scaffold UI changes).\n\n## Context\nATProto's PDS has a built-in OAuth authorization server with a password-based sign-in form. We want to replace this with email + OTP for the Certified ecosystem (Ma Earth, GainForest, etc.). The PDS is ~80% ready for email OTP — the `emailOtp` field exists in the sign-in schema, `SecondAuthenticationFactorRequiredError` is implemented, email token infrastructure is production-ready, and password is already optional at the AccountManager level. The blocker is a hard `throw new Error('Email OTP is not supported')` in `OAuthStore.authenticateAccount()`.\n\nRather than forking the PDS, we build a **sidecar auth service** that:\n1. Overrides the PDS's OAuth authorization server metadata (`/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`) to redirect the `authorization_endpoint` to itself\n2. Serves its own email input + OTP verification pages\n3. After OTP verification, calls into the PDS's internal `OAuthProvider` APIs to create accounts (if new) and issue OAuth authorization codes\n4. Redirects the user back to the client app with a standard OAuth code\n\nFrom the client app's perspective, this is a normal OAuth flow. The client doesn't know the sidecar exists.\n\n## Location\nAll sidecar code lives under `packages/pds-sidecar/` in the hypercerts-scaffold repo. This is a monorepo with three sub-packages:\n- `packages/pds-sidecar/packages/shared/` — DB, OTP service, rate limiter, HMAC signer, mailer\n- `packages/pds-sidecar/packages/auth-service/` — Express auth service\n- `packages/pds-sidecar/packages/pds-core/` — PDS wrapper\n\n## Architecture\n```\nClient App (scaffold)\n  │\n  │ 1. PAR request\n  │ 8. Token exchange (stock ATProto)\n  ▼\nPDS Core (stock @atproto/pds, unmodified npm package)\n  │  AS metadata overridden:\n  │  authorization_endpoint → auth.pds.certs.network\n  │\n  │ 2. Redirect to sidecar    7. Auth code issued via signed callback\n  ▼                            ▲\nSidecar Auth Service (Express)\n  GET  /oauth/authorize     ← email input form\n  POST /auth/send-code      ← generate OTP, send email\n  POST /auth/verify-code    ← validate OTP\n  GET  /auth/consent        ← consent screen\n  │\n  │ 3-5. Email 6-digit OTP code\n  ▼\nUser's inbox\n```\n\n## Key Design Decisions\n1. **Wrap, don't fork.** `@atproto/pds` is an npm dependency, not modified source.\n2. **Signed callback.** HMAC-SHA256 between sidecar and PDS to prevent account takeover.\n3. **Unified sign-in/sign-up.** New emails get an account auto-created; existing emails get authenticated.\n4. **`login_hint` passthrough.** Client passes email as `login_hint` → sidecar sends OTP immediately.\n5. **Random handles.** New accounts get random handles to avoid leaking emails.\n6. **8-digit OTP codes.** Better brute-force resistance.\n\n## Security Requirements\n- HMAC-SHA256 signed callback between sidecar and PDS\n- OTP codes: 8 digits, SHA-256 hashed before storage, single-use, 15-min expiry, max 5 attempts\n- Rate limiting: per-email (3/15min, 5/hr), per-IP (10/15min)\n- Anti-enumeration: show OTP form regardless of whether email exists\n- CSRF protection: double-submit cookie with timing-safe comparison\n- Security headers: HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Sidecar starts alongside stock PDS, overrides AS metadata\n- Email OTP flow works end-to-end\n- New accounts auto-created with random handles\n- Callback between sidecar and PDS is HMAC-signed\n- Rate limiting and anti-enumeration in place","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","assignee":"sharfy-test.climateai.org","owner":"sharfy-test.climateai.org","created_at":"2026-02-17T18:12:07.512977+08:00","created_by":"sharfy-test.climateai.org","updated_at":"2026-02-18T15:50:27.496331+08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-18T15:50:27.496334+08:00","labels":["scope:medium"]}

For now, just log 'PDS core starting...' and export a placeholder `startPDS()` function.\n- Dependencies: @atproto/pds\n\n### TypeScript config\n- Root `tsconfig.json` with project references\n- Each package has its own `tsconfig.json` extending root\n- Target: ES2022, module: Node16, strict: true\n\n### IMPORTANT: Do not modify the root scaffold package.json\nThe sidecar has its own independent package.json and node_modules.

{"id":"hypercerts-qc3.6","title":"Implement auth service routes: send-code, verify-code, authorize","description":"## Files\n- packages/auth-service/src/routes/authorize.ts (create)\n- packages/auth-service/src/routes/send-code.ts (create)\n- packages/auth-service/src/routes/verify-code.ts (create)\n- packages/auth-service/src/middleware/security.ts (create)\n- packages/auth-service/src/middleware/csrf.ts (create)\n- packages/auth-service/src/index.ts (modify)\n\n## What to do\nImplement the three core auth service routes that handle the email OTP flow. These are the routes that the user's browser interacts with after being redirected from the PDS.\n\n### Flow overview\n1. PDS redirects user to sidecar: `GET /oauth/authorize?request_uri=urn:...\u0026client_id=...\u0026login_hint=user@example.com`\n2. Sidecar shows email form (or auto-sends OTP if `login_hint` is present)\n3. User submits email → `POST /auth/send-code` → sidecar sends OTP email\n4. User enters code → `POST /auth/verify-code` → sidecar verifies OTP\n5. On success: sidecar builds HMAC-signed callback URL and redirects to PDS\n\n### `middleware/security.ts`\nAdd security headers to all responses:\n- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`\n- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`\n- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`\n- `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data:`\n\n### `middleware/csrf.ts`\nImplement double-submit cookie CSRF protection:\n- On GET requests: generate a random CSRF token, set it as a cookie (`csrf-token`, HttpOnly=false so JS can read it, Secure in production, SameSite=Lax`)\n- On POST requests: compare the `csrf-token` cookie with the `x-csrf-token` header using `crypto.timingSafeEqual`\n- Reject with 403 if they don't match\n\n### `routes/authorize.ts` — `GET /oauth/authorize`\nThis is the entry point — the PDS redirects here after PAR.\n\n**Query params:** `request_uri`, `client_id`, `login_hint` (optional)\n\n**Logic:**\n1. Validate `request_uri` is present (required)\n2. Store `request_uri` and `client_id` in a session cookie (encrypted or signed) so they survive the send-code/verify-code round-trip\n3. If `login_hint` is present and looks like an email (contains `@`):\n   - Auto-trigger OTP send (call OTPService.generateOTP + Mailer.sendOTP)\n   - Render the OTP verification page directly (skip email input)\n4. If no `login_hint` or it's not an email:\n   - Render the email input page\n\n**Pages:** Server-rendered HTML (use a simple template function, no React needed):\n- Email input page: form with email input, 'Continue' button\n- OTP verification page: form with 8-digit code input, 'Verify' button, 'Resend code' link, masked email display (e.g., 'u***@example.com')\n\n### `routes/send-code.ts` — `POST /auth/send-code`\n**Body:** `{ email: string }`\n\n**Logic:**\n1. Validate CSRF token\n2. Check rate limits (per-email burst + hourly, per-IP)\n3. Normalize email (lowercase, trim)\n4. Generate OTP via OTPService\n5. Send OTP via Mailer\n6. **Anti-enumeration:** Always respond with success, even if the email doesn't exist in the system. The OTP is generated regardless — if the email is new, the account will be created after verification.\n7. Store email in session cookie for the verify step\n8. Respond with redirect to OTP verification page (or JSON `{ success: true }` if called via fetch)\n\n### `routes/verify-code.ts` — `POST /auth/verify-code`\n**Body:** `{ code: string }`\n\n**Logic:**\n1. Validate CSRF token\n2. Check rate limits (per-IP verify limit)\n3. Retrieve email from session cookie\n4. Verify OTP via OTPService\n5. If invalid: re-render OTP page with error message\n6. If valid:\n   a. Check if email exists in the accounts table\n   b. If new email: set `newAccount = true`\n   c. Build HMAC-signed callback URL using CallbackSigner\n   d. Redirect to PDS callback: `{pdsUrl}/oauth/magic-callback?request_uri=...\u0026email=...\u0026approved=1\u0026new_account=...\u0026timestamp=...\u0026sig=...`\n\n### Session cookies\nUse a signed cookie (using the HMAC secret) to store the OAuth flow state across requests:\n```typescript\ninterface AuthFlowSession {\n  requestUri: string;\n  clientId: string;\n  email?: string;\n}\n```\nSign with HMAC-SHA256 using the same shared secret. Set HttpOnly, Secure (in production), SameSite=Lax, Max-Age=600 (10 minutes).\n\n## Don't\n- Don't use React or any frontend framework for the HTML pages — use template literals\n- Don't implement the PDS-side callback handler (that's a separate task in pds-core)\n- Don't implement consent screens (that's a future task)\n- Don't fetch OAuth client metadata for branding (future enhancement)","acceptance_criteria":"1.

POST /auth/verify-code with correct code redirects to PDS callback with HMAC signature\n6. POST /auth/verify-code with wrong code re-renders OTP page with error\n7.

{"id":"hypercerts-qc3.7","title":"Implement PDS core wrapper with OAuth metadata override and magic-callback endpoint","description":"## Files\n- packages/pds-core/src/index.ts (modify)\n- packages/pds-core/src/metadata-override.ts (create)\n- packages/pds-core/src/magic-callback.ts (create)\n- packages/pds-core/src/account-creator.ts (create)\n\n## What to do\nImplement the PDS wrapper that starts a stock `@atproto/pds` instance with two additions: (1) an Express middleware that overrides the OAuth authorization server metadata to point to the sidecar, and (2) a `/oauth/magic-callback` endpoint that accepts HMAC-signed callbacks from the sidecar and issues OAuth authorization codes.\n\n### Background\nThe stock PDS serves `GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` which returns metadata including `authorization_endpoint` pointing to itself. We intercept this and rewrite `authorization_endpoint` to point to the sidecar auth service. All other OAuth endpoints (PAR, token, JWKS) remain on the PDS.\n\nAfter the sidecar verifies the user's OTP, it redirects the user's browser to `/oauth/magic-callback` on the PDS with HMAC-signed parameters. The PDS verifies the signature, then uses its internal `OAuthProvider` to issue an authorization code and redirect the user back to the client app.\n\n### `metadata-override.ts`\nExport a function `createMetadataOverride(authServiceUrl: string): RequestHandler` that:\n1. Intercepts `GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`\n2. Calls `next()` to let the stock PDS generate the response\n3. Captures the response body (use response interception — override `res.json` or use a response-capture middleware pattern)\n4. Replaces `authorization_endpoint` with `${authServiceUrl}/oauth/authorize`\n5. Sends the modified response\n\n**Important:** This middleware must be mounted BEFORE the PDS middleware in the Express stack so it can intercept the response.\n\n### `magic-callback.ts`\nExport a function `createMagicCallback(pds: PDS, callbackSigner: CallbackSigner): RequestHandler` that handles `GET /oauth/magic-callback`:\n\n1. Parse query parameters using `CallbackSigner.parseCallbackUrl`\n2. Verify the HMAC signature using `callbackSigner.verify()`\n3. If invalid: return 403 with error\n4. If `approved !== true`: return 403 'Request not approved'\n5. If `newAccount === true`:\n   - Call `accountCreator.createAccount(email)` to create a new ATProto account\n6. Look up the user's DID from the email (query the sidecar's accounts table or the PDS's internal account manager)\n7. Use the PDS's internal `OAuthProvider` to:\n   a. Load the pending PAR request using `requestUri`\n   b. Create or load a device session for the user\n   c. Mark the request as authorized for the user's DID\n   d. Generate an authorization code\n   e. Build the redirect URL back to the client app\n8. Redirect the user's browser to the client app with the authorization code\n\n**Accessing PDS internals:** The PDS instance exposes `pds.ctx.oauthProvider` (accessed via `as any` cast since it's not part of the public API). Key internal APIs:\n- `pds.ctx.oauthProvider.deviceManager` — manage device sessions\n- `pds.ctx.oauthProvider.requestManager` — load PAR requests\n- `pds.ctx.accountManager` — look up accounts by email\n\n**Note:** These are internal APIs that may change between `@atproto/pds` versions. Document each access point with a comment noting the PDS version it was tested against.\n\n### `account-creator.ts`\nExport a class `AccountCreator` that creates new ATProto accounts on the PDS:\n\n```typescript\nasync createAccount(email: string): Promise\u003c{ did: string; handle: string }\u003e\n```\n\n1. Generate a random handle: `${randomBase36(6)}.${pdsDomain}` (e.g., `a3x9kf.pds.certs.network`)\n2. Generate a random throwaway password: `crypto.randomBytes(64).toString('hex')`\n3. Call the PDS's internal account creation (via `pds.ctx.accountManager` or the XRPC endpoint `com.atproto.server.createAccount`)\n4. Store the email→DID mapping in the sidecar's accounts table\n5. Return `{ did, handle }`\n\n### `index.ts` — PDS startup\n1. Import and configure `@atproto/pds`\n2. Create the PDS instance with environment-based config\n3. Mount the metadata override middleware BEFORE PDS middleware\n4. Mount the magic-callback endpoint\n5. Start the server\n\n**Environment variables needed:**\n- `PDS_HOSTNAME` — e.g., `pds.certs.network`\n- `PDS_DATA_DIRECTORY` — path to PDS data\n- `PDS_BLOBSTORE_DISK_LOCATION` — blob storage path\n- `PDS_DID_PLC_URL` — PLC directory URL\n- `PDS_ADMIN_PASSWORD` — PDS admin password\n- `AUTH_SERVICE_URL` — sidecar URL (e.g., `https://auth.pds.certs.network`)\n- `CALLBACK_SECRET` — shared HMAC secret for signed callbacks\n\n## Don't\n- Don't fork or modify `@atproto/pds` source code — use it as a dependency\n- Don't implement the auth service routes (those are in the auth-service package)\n- Don't implement email sending (that's in the auth-service via shared mailer)\n- Don't disable stock login endpoints yet (that's a separate hardening task)\n- Don't implement consent screens","acceptance_criteria":"1.

{"id":"hypercerts-xpo","title":"Epic: Organization Membership \u0026 RBAC Backend","description":"## Goal\nBuild the application-layer organization membership and role-based access control (RBAC) system. Users belong to organizations with roles (admin, contributor, viewer) that control who can write to org repos.\n\n## Context\nATProto has NO native org support — no multi-signature repos, no RBAC, no org identity, no delegation tokens. Every repo has exactly one signing key. All org logic must live in our application layer.\n\nThe architecture doc specifies:\n- Our backend maintains org membership (user_did → [org_ids])\n- Roles: admin, contributor, viewer\n- Org repos are DID-based accounts whose signing keys we hold server-side\n- The org/RBAC layer is completely independent of how users authenticate\n\nThis is a parallel workstream to the auth work. It does NOT depend on the OTP/sidecar being complete.\n\n### How Orgs Work in ATProto\nEach org is a regular ATProto account (has a DID, a handle, a repo). The difference:\n- The org's signing key is held by our backend (not by any individual user)\n- Our backend mediates all writes to the org's repo\n- Users don't directly interact with the org's PDS account — they go through our API\n\n### Data Model\n```\norganizations\n  id: UUID\n  did: TEXT (the org's ATProto DID)\n  handle: TEXT (e.g., maearth.certified.app)\n  name: TEXT\n  created_at: TIMESTAMP\n\norg_memberships\n  org_id: UUID (FK → organizations.id)\n  user_did: TEXT (the user's ATProto DID)\n  role: TEXT (admin | contributor | viewer)\n  invited_by: TEXT (DID of inviter)\n  created_at: TIMESTAMP\n  PRIMARY KEY (org_id, user_did)\n```\n\n## Hard Constraints\n- All org data lives in our application DB (SQLite for now, Postgres later)\n- Org repos are real ATProto accounts on the same PDS\n- Org signing keys are held server-side (encrypted, like user passwords)\n- No ATProto protocol changes — pure application layer\n- Must work with the existing PDS sidecar architecture\n\n## Success Looks Like\n- CRUD API for organizations\n- Membership management (invite, remove, change role)\n- Role-based permission checks on all org operations\n- Org accounts created on the PDS with server-held signing keys\n- Users can see all orgs they belong to after login","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","assignee":"sharfy-test.climateai.org","owner":"sharfy-test.climateai.org","created_at":"2026-02-18T14:07:37.261395+08:00","created_by":"sharfy-test.climateai.org","updated_at":"2026-02-18T15:44:50.407706+08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-18T15:44:50.40771+08:00","labels":["scope:medium"]}

Also add a handle-based fallback for existing ATProto/Bluesky users.\n\n## Context\nThe scaffold currently has handle-based login only:\n- components/login-dialog.tsx: form with handle input, calls useLoginMutation\n- app/api/auth/login/route.ts: POST handler that calls sdk.authorize(handle)\n- app/api/auth/callback/route.ts: OAuth callback handler (works for both flows)\n- providers/SignedInProvider.tsx: auth gate that shows LoginDialog if not signed in\n\n## What Needs to Change\n1. New /login page with email input as primary option + handle fallback as secondary\n2. New /api/auth/email-login route that calls sdk.authorize(pdsUrl, { login_hint: email })\n3. New useEmailLoginMutation hook\n4. The existing handle-based flow stays untouched — both coexist\n\n## The Email Login Flow\n1. User visits /login, enters email, clicks Continue\n2. Scaffold POSTs to /api/auth/email-login with { email }\n3. Route calls sdk.authorize(NEXT_PUBLIC_PDS_URL) — this is the key shortcut: passing the PDS URL directly skips handle resolution\n4. The authorize URL includes login_hint=email as a query parameter\n5. Browser redirects to PDS → PDS metadata points to sidecar → sidecar shows OTP form\n6. After OTP verification, browser redirects back to /api/auth/callback (same as handle flow)\n7. User is logged in\n\n## Key Technical Detail\nsdk.authorize() accepts a handle, DID, or PDS URL. When given a PDS URL like 'https://certified.app', it skips handle→DID→PDS resolution and goes directly to that PDS. The login_hint parameter is passed through to the authorization URL so the sidecar can auto-send the OTP.\n\n## Existing Code to Reference\n- lib/config.ts: has config.pdsUrl (from NEXT_PUBLIC_PDS_URL env var)\n- lib/hypercerts-sdk.ts: SDK initialization with sdk.authorize()\n- queries/auth.ts: useLoginMutation hook\n- components/login-dialog.tsx: existing handle login UI\n\n## Hard Constraints\n- Don't break the existing handle-based login\n- Don't modify the OAuth callback route\n- Email-first must be the primary/default option on /login\n- Handle fallback must be secondary (smaller, below a divider)","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","assignee":"sharfy-test.climateai.org","owner":"sharfy-test.climateai.org","created_at":"2026-02-18T15:47:46.193644+08:00","created_by":"sharfy-test.climateai.org","updated_at":"2026-02-18T15:54:59.058144+08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-18T15:54:59.058146+08:00","labels":["scope:small"]}
