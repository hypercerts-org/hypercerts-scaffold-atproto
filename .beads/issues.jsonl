{"id":"hypercerts-b08.3","title":"Fix avatar camera icon getting clipped on profile page","description":"## Files\n- components/image-uploader.tsx (modify)\n\n## What to do\nWhen the avatar has an image, the camera icon overlay button (the edit/replace button) is positioned at `bottom-0 right-0` inside a container that has `overflow-hidden` and `rounded-full`. Because the circle clips the corners, the camera button gets cut off — it sits in the corner of the bounding box but the circle masks it.\n\nThe fix: move the camera icon button **outside** the overflow-hidden container so it is not clipped, but still visually anchored to the bottom-right of the avatar circle.\n\n### Approach\nIn `image-uploader.tsx`, for the `aspect=\"square\"` (avatar) case only:\n\n1. The camera button (lines 65-74) needs to sit outside the `overflow-hidden` container but still be positioned relative to it. The simplest approach: wrap the entire component in a `relative` container and move the camera button to be a sibling of the overflow-hidden div rather than a child of it. \n\n2. Specifically for the avatar case (`!isBanner`), the camera button should be positioned at the bottom-right edge of the circle. A good position is `bottom-0 right-0` on the outer relative wrapper (which does NOT have overflow-hidden).\n\n3. For the banner case (`isBanner`), keep the current behavior (`bottom-2 right-2` inside the overflow container) since banners are rectangular and dont clip.\n\n4. Make sure the camera button circle is fully visible — the entire round button with the camera icon should be shown, not cut off.\n\n### Current structure (simplified):\n```\n\u003cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-full\"\u003e \u003c!-- clips everything --\u003e\n  \u003cImage /\u003e\n  \u003cbutton class=\"bottom-0 right-0\"\u003e \u003c!-- gets clipped --\u003e\n    \u003cCamera /\u003e\n  \u003c/button\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\n### Target structure for avatar:\n```\n\u003cdiv class=\"relative\"\u003e \u003c!-- no overflow-hidden, positions the button --\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-full\"\u003e \u003c!-- clips only the image --\u003e\n    \u003cImage /\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003cbutton class=\"absolute bottom-0 right-0 z-10\"\u003e \u003c!-- not clipped --\u003e\n    \u003cCamera /\u003e\n  \u003c/button\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\nFor banner, keep the button inside the overflow container as it is today.\n\n## Dont\n- Do NOT change the avatar size (w-24 h-24)\n- Do NOT change the banner layout or positioning\n- Do NOT change the profile-form.tsx file\n- Do NOT remove the ring-4 ring-background styling (that comes from profile-form.tsx parent)\n- Do NOT change the camera icon size or styling (bg-black/40, backdrop-blur, etc.) — only change its positioning/nesting","acceptance_criteria":"The camera icon button on the avatar is fully visible as a complete circle — not clipped by the rounded avatar container.

The left panel contains the H1 heading (logo/branding area) and is currently styled with a light gray background (`#f0f0f3`). Change it to dark navy `#0F2544`.\n\n### 1. Left panel background (line ~270-274)\n```css\n/* Left panel styling */\n.md\\\\:bg-slate-100,\n.dark .md\\\\:bg-slate-100,\n.md\\\\:dark\\\\:bg-slate-800 {\n  background-color: #f0f0f3 !important;  /* CHANGE to #0F2544 */\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Text contrast in the left panel\nSince the background is now dark, any text rendered in the left panel needs to be light. The H1 text color is currently `#2b2d31` (dark). Update:\n\n- Line ~137: `.grid h1.text-primary::after` color → `#ffffff` (or remove if task .8 replaces this with an image — but set it to white as a fallback)\n- Line ~203: `main.flex.flex-col.items-center \u003e h1.text-primary` color → `#ffffff`\n\nAlso check the `.text-primary` override at line ~317-318:\n```css\n.text-primary {\n  color: #757780 !important;\n}\n```\nThis is a global override that affects text across ALL pages (sign-in, authorize, error).

{"id":"hypercerts-nyk.9","title":"Add Certified C logo next to sign-in buttons in scaffold UI","description":"## Files\n- components/login-dialog.tsx (modify)\n- components/navbar.tsx (modify)\n\n## What to do\nAdd the Certified 'C' logo (`/public/certified-logo.svg`) next to the sign-in buttons in the scaffold's own UI. This is the app's internal branding (separate from the PDS OAuth page branding).\n\nThe SVG is at `/certified-logo.svg` (39x43px, blue checkmark + white partial circle on transparent background). Since the scaffold UI has a light background, the white paths in the SVG won't be visible. The blue checkmark (#60A1E2) will be visible.\n\n### 1. Login Dialog (`components/login-dialog.tsx`)\nThe main sign-in form shown when unauthenticated. Add the logo next to the 'Sign In' button (line 70-77):\n\n```tsx\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\n// Inside the Sign In button (line 70-77):\n\u003cButton type=\"submit\" disabled={loginMutation.isPending} className=\"...\"\u003e\n  {loginMutation.isPending \u0026\u0026 \u003cSpinner /\u003e}\n  \u003cImage src=\"/certified-logo.svg\" alt=\"Certified\" width={20} height={22} className=\"inline-block\" /\u003e\n  Sign In\n\u003c/Button\u003e\n```\n\nAlso add it next to the 'Create an account' button (line 78-86):\n```tsx\n\u003cButton ... variant=\"ghost\" type=\"button\" className=\"...\"\u003e\n  \u003cImage src=\"/certified-logo.svg\" alt=\"Certified\" width={16} height={18} className=\"inline-block\" /\u003e\n  Create an account\n\u003c/Button\u003e\n```\n\n### 2. Navbar (`components/navbar.tsx`)\nThe compact sign-in popover in the navbar. Add the logo next to the 'Sign In' submit button (line 214-221):\n\n```tsx\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\n// Inside the popover Sign In button:\n\u003cButton type=\"submit\" size=\"sm\" disabled={loginMutation.isPending} className=\"...\"\u003e\n  \u003cImage src=\"/certified-logo.svg\" alt=\"Certified\" width={16} height={18} className=\"inline-block\" /\u003e\n  {loginMutation.isPending ? \"Signing in...\" : \"Sign In\"}\n\u003c/Button\u003e\n```\n\nUse `next/image` for the Image component (already available in the project). Size the logo proportionally — roughly 20x22px for the main button, 16x18px for smaller buttons. The logo should appear to the left of the button text.\n\n## Don't\n- Change button colors, fonts, or other styling\n- Add the logo to the navbar trigger button (the small 'Sign In' button that opens the popover) — only add it inside the popover form and the login dialog\n- Modify any other components\n- Change the SVG file itself","acceptance_criteria":"1. The login dialog 'Sign In' button shows the Certified C logo to the left of the text\n2. The login dialog 'Create an account' button shows the Certified C logo to the left of the text\n3.
