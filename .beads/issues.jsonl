{"id":"hypercerts-b08.3","title":"Fix avatar camera icon getting clipped on profile page","description":"## Files\n- components/image-uploader.tsx (modify)\n\n## What to do\nWhen the avatar has an image, the camera icon overlay button (the edit/replace button) is positioned at `bottom-0 right-0` inside a container that has `overflow-hidden` and `rounded-full`. Because the circle clips the corners, the camera button gets cut off — it sits in the corner of the bounding box but the circle masks it.\n\nThe fix: move the camera icon button **outside** the overflow-hidden container so it is not clipped, but still visually anchored to the bottom-right of the avatar circle.\n\n### Approach\nIn `image-uploader.tsx`, for the `aspect=\"square\"` (avatar) case only:\n\n1. The camera button (lines 65-74) needs to sit outside the `overflow-hidden` container but still be positioned relative to it. The simplest approach: wrap the entire component in a `relative` container and move the camera button to be a sibling of the overflow-hidden div rather than a child of it. \n\n2. Specifically for the avatar case (`!isBanner`), the camera button should be positioned at the bottom-right edge of the circle. A good position is `bottom-0 right-0` on the outer relative wrapper (which does NOT have overflow-hidden).\n\n3. For the banner case (`isBanner`), keep the current behavior (`bottom-2 right-2` inside the overflow container) since banners are rectangular and dont clip.\n\n4. Make sure the camera button circle is fully visible — the entire round button with the camera icon should be shown, not cut off.\n\n### Current structure (simplified):\n```\n\u003cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-full\"\u003e \u003c!-- clips everything --\u003e\n  \u003cImage /\u003e\n  \u003cbutton class=\"bottom-0 right-0\"\u003e \u003c!-- gets clipped --\u003e\n    \u003cCamera /\u003e\n  \u003c/button\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\n### Target structure for avatar:\n```\n\u003cdiv class=\"relative\"\u003e \u003c!-- no overflow-hidden, positions the button --\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-full\"\u003e \u003c!-- clips only the image --\u003e\n    \u003cImage /\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003cbutton class=\"absolute bottom-0 right-0 z-10\"\u003e \u003c!-- not clipped --\u003e\n    \u003cCamera /\u003e\n  \u003c/button\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\nFor banner, keep the button inside the overflow container as it is today.\n\n## Dont\n- Do NOT change the avatar size (w-24 h-24)\n- Do NOT change the banner layout or positioning\n- Do NOT change the profile-form.tsx file\n- Do NOT remove the ring-4 ring-background styling (that comes from profile-form.tsx parent)\n- Do NOT change the camera icon size or styling (bg-black/40, backdrop-blur, etc.) — only change its positioning/nesting","acceptance_criteria":"The camera icon button on the avatar is fully visible as a complete circle — not clipped by the rounded avatar container.

Callback route: early-detect error param (app/api/auth/callback/route.ts)\n\nAt the top of the GET handler, BEFORE calling `sdk.callback(searchParams)`, check if `searchParams` has an `error` param. If it does:\n\n```ts\nconst error = searchParams.get(\"error\");\nif (error) {\n  const description = searchParams.get(\"error_description\") || \"Authorization was cancelled\";\n  console.warn(\"OAuth authorization error:\", error, description);\n  // Redirect back to home with error info for the client to display\n  const redirectUrl = new URL(\"/\", config.baseUrl);\n  redirectUrl.searchParams.set(\"auth_error\", error);\n  redirectUrl.searchParams.set(\"auth_error_description\", description);\n  return NextResponse.redirect(redirectUrl);\n}\n```\n\nAlso update the existing catch block to redirect instead of returning JSON:\n```ts\ncatch (e) {\n  console.error(\"Authentication failed:\", e);\n  const redirectUrl = new URL(\"/\", config.baseUrl);\n  redirectUrl.searchParams.set(\"auth_error\", \"callback_failed\");\n  redirectUrl.searchParams.set(\"auth_error_description\", e instanceof Error ? e.message : \"An unexpected error occurred\");\n  return NextResponse.redirect(redirectUrl);\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Client-side toast in SignedInProvider (providers/SignedInProvider.tsx)\n\nThis component already wraps all pages. Add a `useEffect` that:\n- Reads `auth_error` and `auth_error_description` from the URL search params (use `useSearchParams()` from next/navigation)\n- If `auth_error` is present, show a toast:\n  - If `auth_error === \"access_denied\"`: `toast.error(\"Login cancelled. You can try again when you're ready.\")`\n  - Otherwise: `toast.error(auth_error_description || \"Authentication failed. Please try again.\")`\n- Clean the URL by calling `router.replace(pathname)` (use `usePathname()` and `useRouter()` from next/navigation) to remove the query params\n- The useEffect should depend on searchParams\n\nNote: SignedInProvider currently receives `session` as a prop from the server. The toast logic should run regardless of whether session exists (the user will have no session after a rejection). If SignedInProvider is a server component, you may need to extract the toast logic into a small client component like `AuthErrorToast` and render it inside SignedInProvider.\n\nImport `toast` from `sonner` (already used elsewhere in the project, e.g. in components/navbar.tsx).\n\n## Don't\n- Do NOT create new pages or error boundary files\n- Do NOT modify the login flow (api/auth/login, use-login-mutation, etc.)\n- Do NOT add middleware\n- Do NOT change the successful auth flow at all\n- Do NOT install new dependencies — sonner and next/navigation are already available","acceptance_criteria":"1.

The left panel contains the H1 heading (logo/branding area) and is currently styled with a light gray background (`#f0f0f3`). Change it to dark navy `#0F2544`.\n\n### 1. Left panel background (line ~270-274)\n```css\n/* Left panel styling */\n.md\\\\:bg-slate-100,\n.dark .md\\\\:bg-slate-100,\n.md\\\\:dark\\\\:bg-slate-800 {\n  background-color: #f0f0f3 !important;  /* CHANGE to #0F2544 */\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Text contrast in the left panel\nSince the background is now dark, any text rendered in the left panel needs to be light. The H1 text color is currently `#2b2d31` (dark). Update:\n\n- Line ~137: `.grid h1.text-primary::after` color → `#ffffff` (or remove if task .8 replaces this with an image — but set it to white as a fallback)\n- Line ~203: `main.flex.flex-col.items-center \u003e h1.text-primary` color → `#ffffff`\n\nAlso check the `.text-primary` override at line ~317-318:\n```css\n.text-primary {\n  color: #757780 !important;\n}\n```\nThis is a global override that affects text across ALL pages (sign-in, authorize, error). Since only the left panel is dark, scope the light text to the left panel only.

This is the app's internal branding (separate from the PDS OAuth page branding).\n\nThe SVG is at `/certified-logo.svg` (39x43px, blue checkmark + white partial circle on transparent background). Since the scaffold UI has a light background, the white paths in the SVG won't be visible. The blue checkmark (#60A1E2) will be visible.\n\n### 1. Login Dialog (`components/login-dialog.tsx`)\nThe main sign-in form shown when unauthenticated. Add the logo next to the 'Sign In' button (line 70-77):\n\n```tsx\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\n// Inside the Sign In button (line 70-77):\n\u003cButton type=\"submit\" disabled={loginMutation.isPending} className=\"...\"\u003e\n  {loginMutation.isPending \u0026\u0026 \u003cSpinner /\u003e}\n  \u003cImage src=\"/certified-logo.svg\" alt=\"Certified\" width={20} height={22} className=\"inline-block\" /\u003e\n  Sign In\n\u003c/Button\u003e\n```\n\nAlso add it next to the 'Create an account' button (line 78-86):\n```tsx\n\u003cButton ... variant=\"ghost\" type=\"button\" className=\"...\"\u003e\n  \u003cImage src=\"/certified-logo.svg\" alt=\"Certified\" width={16} height={18} className=\"inline-block\" /\u003e\n  Create an account\n\u003c/Button\u003e\n```\n\n### 2. Navbar (`components/navbar.tsx`)\nThe compact sign-in popover in the navbar. Add the logo next to the 'Sign In' submit button (line 214-221):\n\n```tsx\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\n// Inside the popover Sign In button:\n\u003cButton type=\"submit\" size=\"sm\" disabled={loginMutation.isPending} className=\"...\"\u003e\n  \u003cImage src=\"/certified-logo.svg\" alt=\"Certified\" width={16} height={18} className=\"inline-block\" /\u003e\n  {loginMutation.isPending ? \"Signing in...\" : \"Sign In\"}\n\u003c/Button\u003e\n```\n\nUse `next/image` for the Image component (already available in the project). Size the logo proportionally — roughly 20x22px for the main button, 16x18px for smaller buttons. The logo should appear to the left of the button text.\n\n## Don't\n- Change button colors, fonts, or other styling\n- Add the logo to the navbar trigger button (the small 'Sign In' button that opens the popover) — only add it inside the popover form and the login dialog\n- Modify any other components\n- Change the SVG file itself","acceptance_criteria":"1. The login dialog 'Sign In' button shows the Certified C logo to the left of the text\n2. The login dialog 'Create an account' button shows the Certified C logo to the left of the text\n3.

Install dependencies\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev prettier husky lint-staged eslint-config-prettier\n```\n\n### 2. Fix and expand .prettierrc.json\n\nReplace the current broken config with:\n```json\n{\n  \"semi\": true,\n  \"singleQuote\": false,\n  \"tabWidth\": 2,\n  \"trailingComma\": \"all\",\n  \"printWidth\": 80,\n  \"plugins\": [],\n  \"endOfLine\": \"lf\"\n}\n```\n\nNote: `singleQuote: false` preserves the existing codebase convention (double quotes are used everywhere). The old config had `\"single\": false` which is not a valid Prettier key.\n\n### 3. Create .prettierignore\n\n```\nnode_modules/\n.next/\nout/\nbuild/\ncoverage/\n*.tgz\npnpm-lock.yaml\npackage-lock.json\n.beads/\nvendor/\n```\n\n### 4. Add eslint-config-prettier to ESLint config\n\nIn `eslint.config.mjs`, import and add `eslint-config-prettier` to disable ESLint rules that conflict with Prettier. The config should look like:\n\n```js\nimport { defineConfig, globalIgnores } from \"eslint/config\";\nimport nextVitals from \"eslint-config-next/core-web-vitals\";\nimport nextTs from \"eslint-config-next/typescript\";\nimport prettierConfig from \"eslint-config-prettier\";\n\nconst eslintConfig = defineConfig([\n  ...nextVitals,\n  ...nextTs,\n  prettierConfig,\n  globalIgnores([\n    \".next/**\",\n    \"out/**\",\n    \"build/**\",\n    \"next-env.d.ts\",\n  ]),\n]);\n\nexport default eslintConfig;\n```\n\n### 5. Initialize Husky\n\n```bash\nnpx husky init\n```\n\nThis creates `.husky/pre-commit`. Replace its contents with:\n\n```bash\nnpx lint-staged\n```\n\n### 6. Add lint-staged config to package.json\n\nAdd this to package.json at the top level:\n\n```json\n\"lint-staged\": {\n  \"*.{ts,tsx,mjs}\": [\n    \"prettier --write\"\n  ],\n  \"*.{ts,tsx}\": [\n    \"eslint --fix\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### 7. Add scripts to package.json\n\nAdd these scripts (keep existing ones):\n\n```json\n\"format\": \"prettier --write .\",\n\"format:check\": \"prettier --check .\",\n\"prepare\": \"husky\"\n```\n\nThe `prepare` script ensures husky hooks are installed after `npm install`.\n\n### 8. Verify\n\n- Run `npx prettier --check .` — it will likely show files that need formatting (that is OK, we are not reformatting in this task)\n- Run `npm run lint` — should pass\n- Run `npx tsc --noEmit` — should pass\n- Test the hook: stage a file, commit, verify lint-staged runs\n\n## Don't\n- Do NOT reformat the entire codebase (that is a separate task)\n- Do NOT change any ESLint rules (only add eslint-config-prettier to disable conflicting formatting rules)\n- Do NOT add prettier plugins (like prettier-plugin-tailwindcss) — keep it simple\n- Do NOT modify any source files (.ts, .tsx) in this task","acceptance_criteria":"1. prettier is in devDependencies and npx prettier --version works\n2. husky is in devDependencies and .husky/pre-commit exists with \"npx lint-staged\"\n3. lint-staged is in devDependencies and configured in package.json\n4. eslint-config-prettier is in devDependencies and added to eslint.config.mjs\n5. .prettierrc.json has valid config (no \"single\" typo — uses \"singleQuote\")\n6. .prettierignore exists and ignores node_modules, .next, build artifacts\n7. package.json has \"format\", \"format:check\", and \"prepare\" scripts\n8. npm run lint passes (no ESLint errors)\n9. npx tsc --noEmit passes\n10.

The catch block currently returns { error: 'Internal server error', details: (e as Error).message } (line 122). The apiClient in lib/api/client.ts only reads the 'error' field from the JSON response (line 56), so the 'details' field with the actual error message is silently dropped. The mutation hook onError toast will show 'Internal server error' instead of the actual error reason. Fix: change the catch block to return { error: `Failed to add attachment: ${(e as Error).message}` } — drop the 'details' field and put the message in 'error'.
